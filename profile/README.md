Ferrara Squadra Corse is a project born from the desire of some Mechanical and Electronic Engineering students to bring Formula Student to the University of Ferrara.

We started from a simple concept: to combine environmental sustainability and the future of mobility with our passion for motorsport.

The car that we are preparing, will in fact have an architecture based on 4 electric motors mounted on the four wheels of the single-seater, 
which combined with a refined care of the tubular frame and the aerodynamics of the carbon fiber bodywork, 
slowly points to a growing competitiveness in the field of international Formula Student competition.
